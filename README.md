# open_addressing_hash_table
An implementation of an open addressing hash table comparing linear and quadratic probing collision resolution strategies. The code runs an experiment measuring average probing steps across 100 trials using randomly generated 4-digit keys and then compares the results. This was originally taken from an in-class homework and modified.
